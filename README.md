Toy HTTP server implementation, with tons of toys used

> ## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ WARNING ⚠️⚠️⚠️
> This project is totally a toy, implemented together with tons of toys implemented on myself.
> Codes are not guaranteed to work, and not guaranteed to be safe, of course. Except for the
> fact that this project should not be used in real-world production (you may want OpenResty instead),
> the C programming language used is not of good practice. Don't read this project code if you're
> beginner, in order not to be misleaded.
